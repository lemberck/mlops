Thank you for installing helm-sentiment-analysis-mlops!

Your application is now deployed and should be up and running.

To interact with the deployed frontend service from outside the cluster:

1. For minikube, ensure the minikube tunnel is running in another terminal:

minikube tunnel

2. Then, you can access the frontend service in your browser via the external IP provided by the LoadBalancer:

minikube service frontend-service-loadbalancer -n sentiment-analysis-mlops

>>> Note : Please be aware that the service requires approximately 15-30 SECONDS to finalize the setup for both the frontend and backend.

3. To uninstall and delete a release in Helm, run the command below, which will remove all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and delete the release:

helm uninstall sentiment-analysis --namespace sentiment-analysis-mlops

4. Delete the created namespace

kubectl delete namespace sentiment-analysis-mlops

Enjoy!
